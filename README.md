Welcome to my VLSI Projects repository! This collection includes various digital design and verification projects implemented using Verilog, SystemVerilog, and UVM. These projects demonstrate my hands-on experience with RTL design, testbench creation, and functional verification using industry-standard methodologies.

Tools Used

Simulation: VCS

Synthesis: Xilinx, Synopsys Design Compiler

Verification: UVM Methodology

Coding: Verilog, SystemVerilog
